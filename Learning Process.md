# Learning Process

1. Take notes on concept of interest, creating additional notes that are bidirectionally linked in the process. Goal of this step is building structure, specific examples aren't as important here.
2. After you're happy with the structure, expand out previously linked concepts -- list out specific examples, implementing them in code where possible.
3. Implement a repitious process for reinenforcing the ideas so that they can be pulled instantly later when needed, regardless of context. Successful methods here will have testable metrics for seeing improvement.

	2. Lap-based goal achievement (Speedrunning)
