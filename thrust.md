# Thrust
#rocket-engineering

Reaction force described quantitaively by [[Newton's Third Law]]. When a system expels or [[Acceleration|accelerates]] mass in one direction, the [[Acceleration|accelerated]] [[mass]] will cause a [[force]] of equal [[magnitude]] but opposite direction to be applied to that system.

Thrust equation:

$$T = v\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}$$


$T$ = Thrust
$v$ = [[Velocity]]
$\Delta m$ = Change of mass
$\Delta t$ = Change in time
