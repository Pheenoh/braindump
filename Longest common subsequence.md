# Longest Common Subsequence
#computer-science #algorithm 

Longest common subsequence is a dynamic programming [[algorithm]] that compares two sets of elements and gives the set of elements that is in the same sequence (doesn't necessarily have to be contiguous) in both, as well as that sequence's length.

## Code Example
```python
# finish me
```
