## Life is hard

We all experience low points in our life, and may even get desperate about our lack of [[self regulation]]. Sometimes, life is hard.

It's important to capture this state in order to properly deal with it and similar states in the future. Joscha's view on this: the present rarely is what makes you unhappy. Instead, it is usually some amalgam of your memories and expectations -- it's either the expectation that in the future something won't be the way you want it to be or the memory that something wasn't the way you wanted it to be.

But when you zoom out, you realize what's actually happening is just a consciousness state -- a software state. Software doesn't have an [[identity]], it's a physical law. We are largely randomly instantiated on a substrate we didn't choose.

The illusion that you are an [[agent]] is a [[construct]]. [[conscious|Consciousness]] is a [[control]] [[model]] for your [[attentional]] mechanisms.
