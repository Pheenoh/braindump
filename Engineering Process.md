# Engineering Process

- [[Physics]] as a basis for understanding whether or not a problem is solvable.
	- Make sure you're not violating physics

- First principals analysis is the process of boiling down a problem to it's axiomatic basis. What are we *the most confident* is true, then reason up from there. Tun tests and cross check the result of the tests with the axiomatic basis. If the result violates the axioms, there's a problem with one or more of the axioms; you've have made a bad assumption. Laws of physics are axioms that can't be violated.
