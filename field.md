# Field
#math

A field is a [[set]] of these three things:

- set of objects
- addition operator 
- multiplication operator

A field is a fundamental algebraic structure.

## Axioms
---

For something to be a field, it must satisfy these [[axiomatic]] constraints:

**Associative Property**

Rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result.

$$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$

**Commutative Property**

Changing the order of the [[operands]] does not change the result



$$a + b = b +a$$

**Identity**

$$ a + 0 = a$$
**Inverse**
