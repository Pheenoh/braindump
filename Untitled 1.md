# Twilight Princess Leaderboard Notes

Potential paths forward for allowing emu:

- Split boards - Boards for all categories would be GCN / Wii / Emulator
	- Pros:
		- Don't need to worry about lag/load differences if we require a specific version of Dolphin with specific settings
		- Don't need to worry about setting arbitrary placement requirements
	- Cons:
		- Detracts from more "official" runs done on console

- Joined boards - There are only GCN / Wii boards and the run is identified as Emulator by platform
	- Pros:
		- 
	- Cons:
		- Until we have cycle accurate GCN/Wii emulators, we have to figure out a placement limit and set it either at a category level or leaderboard level

- Both paths
	- Pros:
		- Increased exposure and accessibility
	- Cons:
		- Increased risk of cheating
