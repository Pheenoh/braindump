# Rocket Engines

Rocket engines work under a basic concept -- throw stuff out the back as quickly as possible. The more stuff you can throw out the back and the quicker you can throw it out, the more [[thrust]] you can produce.

Rocket engines can create thrust in many ways. The most basic way is to store a gas in a pressurized container and then have one end of the container connected to a valve and open the valve; the gas will want to push itself out towards the valve due to pressure outside the container being lower than the pressure inside the container (see: [[Bernoulli's Principle]]).

Modern rocket engines convert [[pressure]] and [[heat]] into [[kinetic energy]]. This is done by combusting a [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] inside a combustion chamber and forcing it through a de lavel nozzle.
