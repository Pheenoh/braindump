# Breadth-first Search
#computer-science #algorithm 

Search [[algorithm]] that traverses a graph horizontally first before traversing it vertically when looking for a value.

When traversing a graph that is not in a tree format, you need to keep track of which nodes have been visited to avoid ending up in an infinite loop.

## Code Example
```python
# finish me
```
