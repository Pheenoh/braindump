## Kubernetes Namespaces
#k8s

In [[Kubernetes]], namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. 

Names of resources must be unique within a namespace, but can be the same across multiple namespaces. If a resource in Kubernetes is not namesapce scoped, it applies cluster wide (must be unique cluster wide).

## Linux Namespaces
#linux

Namespaces are a feature of the [[Linux]] [[kernel]] that partitions kernel resources such that one set of [[processes]] sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set.
